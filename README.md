The official dojo 2 build command.

*WARNING* This is _beta_ software. While we do not anticipate significant changes to the API at this stage, we may feel the need to do so. This is not yet production ready, so you should use at your own risk.

## Usage

To use `@dojo/cli-build` in a single project, install the package:

```bash
npm install @dojo/cli-build-webpack
```

to use `@dojo/cli-build-webpack` in every project, install the project globally:

```bash
npm install -g @dojo/cli-build-webpack
```

## Features

`@dojo/cli-build-webpack` is an optional command for the [`@dojo/cli`](https://github.com/dojo/cli).

### Building

To build a Dojo 2 application for publishing:

```bash
dojo build webpack
```

This command will output the built files to the `dist` directory.  After running this command, you can open the `dist/index.html` file to see your application.

You can also build in watch mode, which will automatically rebuild your application when it changes:

```bash
dojo build webpack -w
```

`@dojo/cli-build-webpack` can be customized further. Use the help option to see everything you can do:

```bash
dojo build webpack --help
```

### Building a custom element

`@dojo/cli-build-webpack` can also build custom web elements as per the [custom web v1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/WD-custom-elements-20161013/). Custom elements are built by providing the name of a [custom element descriptor](https://github.com/dojo/widget-core#web-components).

```bash
dojo build webpack --element=src/path/to/createTheSpecialElement.ts
```

This will output a `dist/the-special` directory containing:

* `the-special.js` - JavaScript file containing code specific to the `TheSpecial` widget.
* `widget-core.js` - JavaScript file containing shared widget code. This is separated to allow for better caching by the browser.
* `the-special.css` - CSS relating to the `TheSpecial` widget.
* `the-special.html` - HTML import file that will import all the scripts and styles needed to use the element.

If the source file does not follow the pattern `create[custom element]Element`, `@dojo/cli-build-webpack` cannot determine what the name of the custom element should be. In this case, you can specify the `--elementPrefix` option to explicitly name the element.

```bash
dojo build webpack --element=src/path/to/element.ts --elementPrefix=the-special
```

### Eject

Ejecting `@dojo/cli-build-webpack` will produce a `config/build-webpack/webpack.config.js` file. You can run build using webpack with:

```bash
node_modules/.bin/webpack --config=config/build-webpack/webpack.config.js
```
